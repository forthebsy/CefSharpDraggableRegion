# CefSharpDraggableRegion

You can specify `-webkit-app-region: drag` in CSS to tell **CefSharp** which regions are draggable (like the OS's standard titlebar), and apps can also use `-webkit-app-region: no-drag` to exclude the non-draggable area from the draggable region. Note that only rectangular shapes are currently supported.

To make the whole window draggable, you can add `-webkit-app-region: drag` as `body`'s style:

```html
<body style="-webkit-app-region: drag">
</body>
```

And note that if you have made the whole window draggable, you must also mark buttons as non-draggable, otherwise it would be impossible for users to click on them:

```css
button {
  -webkit-app-region: no-drag;
}
```

If you're only setting a custom titlebar as draggable, you also need to make all buttons in titlebar non-draggable.
